<p>Topics are chosen by the speakers as they see fit. As this is a single-track summit, some speakers adapt their topics based on trending themes. Most presentations have never been given before and may be a year or more away from being given to the general industry. Some are based on confidential research and are shared only with the trusted group of attendees at speakerconf.</p>

<p>Previous themes have included: the industry's capability levels and software craftsmanship; pragmatic testing; multi-paradigm and polyglot programming; functional programming with TDD and BDD; concurrent and parallel computation; next-generation software development processes and anarchic delivery teams; alternative data repositories; observation and cognition and their affects on our decisions; developers and design; building great software companies; P2P synchronization strategies.</p>
